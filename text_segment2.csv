In 2021, we made a total tax contribution of £5,792m globally.

We also take a zero tolerance approach to any person acting for us or on our behalf who helps customers evade tax in any country. The measures we have in place to prevent this include: ■ training designed for all staff on tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation ■ enhanced due diligence procedures for higher risk customers and third parties ■ specific tax evasion ‘red flags’ to help staff identify potential tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation cases ■ assessment and oversight of tax evasion and tax evasion facilitation risk managed through our financial crime risk management framework and related governance.

401,Approach to tax,Tax havens,0.3412514,approach_by_practices, 35 ,  shell-tax-contribution-report-2020pdf  ,"Low-tax jurisdictions, so-called tax havens, are typically considered to mean countries with significantly lower effective tax rates compared with the average rates offered by other countries. In some cases, the corporate income tax rate is zero. Governments have a sovereign right to determine tax matters in their countries and sometimes set low corporate income tax rates to attract investment from outside their borders. In recent years, international organisations, such as the OECD, and many countries have discussed whether a country’s low-tax policy may have a negative impact on other countries. They have also debated various ways of addressing this. Most recently and steered by the G20, the OECD has been developing proposals for a coordinated two-pillar response. Shell supports such an internationally coordinated approach which avoids problems caused by unilateral actions that can lead to the fragmentation of tax rules. Pillar One aims to align taxes more closely with local market engagement so that a larger portion of profits is taxed in the jurisdiction where sales are made, even if a multinational does not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction of sale. Pillar Two introduces new rules to ensure a minimum level of effective taxation for all profits made by multinationals."

This should correspond to where the business activity occurred. The tax due is determined by the tax system of the country or location where that activity took place. Governments design and apply tax rules to the profits generated in their countries and assess what is owed by businesses. Corporate income tax is payable on profits, not revenues.

These treaties include mechanisms for tax authorities to agree an arm’s-length price for a transaction between one another and the taxpayer. These mechanisms can include ‘Mutual Agreement Procedures’ (MAP) which allow tax authorities in two countries to agree on a mutually acceptable arm’s-length price where the taxpayer has been unable to reach an agreement with the tax authorities directly. Treaties may also include a mechanism for tax authorities to agree an arm’s-length price on an upfront basis with a taxpayer through ‘Advance Pricing Agreements’ (APA). Where we are or may be subject to double taxation, we do seek to reach agreement on an appropriate arm’s-length price through one of the generally available mechanisms outlined above."

We do this by fulfilling all of our information sharing obligations under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). CRS requires information relating to customers to be collated and provided to tax authorities who share this information with one another. FATCA is an international standard for the automatic exchange of information relating to US persons. We support the aims of CRS and FATCA and have met all of our 2021 information reporting obligations. Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a key part of the UK government’s plans to become one of the most digitally advanced tax administrations in the world, making it easier for individuals and businesses to comply with their tax obligations and pay the right amount of tax. We are contributing to making MTD a success as we provide a large amount of information to HMRC such as interest earned by our customers on savings accounts as well as details of remuneration paid as an employer. Furthermore, we have put strong governance procedures in place across our business to enable us to fulfil our disclosure obligations under the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (commonly known as DAC 6) and the OECD’s Mandatory Disclosure Rules. These rules help to combat harmful tax practices by requiring the disclosure to tax authorities of cross- border arrangements which feature certain ‘hallmarks’."

Pillar One will reallocate a portion of international businesses’ profits to the territories in which their customers are based for taxation purposes.

Regulated financial services businesses already report, and are taxed on, the profits where their operations are carried out and their customers are based.
